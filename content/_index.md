I'm both a multitalented creative and a technically gifted engineer. Iâ€™m a
well-rounded sound designer and an electronic music musician and producer with
a record label. I used to be a Linux System Administrator. Currently learning
Swift and studying CS Fundamentals (DSA, Complexity, OOP, DDD, Agile).
