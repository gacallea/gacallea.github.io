A few passion sound logos, showcasing different identities and styles. Each one
tailored to intentions and matching their specific aesthetics.

Simple slogans (e.g: *Just Do It*) and witty advertisement campaigns (e.g: [Get
A Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac)) are two examples of effective
brand recognition strategies; potentially leading to brand loyalty and
enshrining a brand into minds.

[Sound branding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_trademark) is the sonic
and auditory equivalent. A distinctive and recognizable sound enables instant
association in customers imaginary.

Think of the Netflix opening sound, the McDonald's jingle, or the BMW logo at
the end of all of their advertisements. Did you hear them? How about the Apple
booting or Windows startup sounds? I bet you do now.
