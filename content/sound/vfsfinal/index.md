The culmination of my [VFS](https://vfs.edu/about-vfs) [Sound Design For Visual
Media](https://vfs.edu/programs/sound-design) diploma. *7th Aeon* is a dystopic
animation by Mads Broni. Original available
[here](https://vimeo.com/247166151).

Besides dialog, music, and sound design, I also rescripted the story with the
aid of [Jacob A.J. Hartland](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9954076/) - a
[VFS](https://vfs.edu/about-vfs) [Writer
Grad](https://vfs.edu/programs/writing). A story about a teenager going on a
killing spree out of boredom and angst. It's her teenage kick.
