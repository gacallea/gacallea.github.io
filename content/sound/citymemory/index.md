[Cities and Memory](https://citiesandmemory.com) is a global project for field
recordists, sound designers, and musicians, to remix the world. One sound at
the time.

I like to partake in their projects with my humble contributions whenever I can.
The following playlist collects them all. Each video description on YouTube has
full details and links of each project I contributed to.
