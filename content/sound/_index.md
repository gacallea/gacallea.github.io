When I left system administration behind, I graduated in [Sound Design For
Visual Media](https://vfs.edu/programs/sound-design) at [Vancouver Film
School](https://vfs.edu/about-vfs) and explored a creative career as a sound
designer. During VFS complete and formative sound design program we learned
acoustics, necessary theory, and several production sound and post-production
disciplines. Including but not limited to: [boom
op](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_operator_(media)>),
[utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_sound_technician), [production
sound mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_sound_mixer), dialog
editing, music editing, [Foley
Artistry](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking)>), [sound
branding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_trademark), [sound
effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_design), game audio, [rerecording
mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-recording_mixer), and [field
recordist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_recording).

On one hand, I'm a qualified sound designer and a one stop shop for your
production and post-production needs. With diverse experience on both ends, to
assist during the entire life span of the production pipeline. On the other
hand, that didn't pan out, and I had to abandon the idea of doing sound design
professionally.
