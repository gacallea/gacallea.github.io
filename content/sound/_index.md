When I left system administration behind, in 2017, I graduated in [Sound Design
For Visual Media](https://vfs.edu/programs/sound-design) at [Vancouver Film
School](https://vfs.edu/about-vfs) and explored a creative career as a sound
designer. During VFS complete and formative sound design program, we learned
several production sound and post-production sound disciplines, including but
not limited to: [boom op](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_operator_(media)),
[utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_sound_technician), [production
sound mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_sound_mixer), dialog
editing, music editing, [Foley
Artistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking)), [sound
branding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_trademark), [sound
effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_design), game audio, [rerecording
mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-recording_mixer), and [field
recordist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_recording).

On one hand, I'm a qualified sound designer and a one stop shop for your
production and post-production needs. With diverse experience on both ends, to
assist during the entire life span of the production pipeline. On the other
hand, that didn't pan out. Thus, I'm determined to become a professional Swift
developer.
