*ISPIRAZIONE* (Italian for Inspiration) is a series of `Enhanced Sound
Collages`. An acrostic comprising a set of nouns describing the characteristics
of a disciplined creative process. Betwixt composition and mixing, where
multiple streams of sound should stimulate the listener to enjoy the story as
if it was a movie. With audio acting in lieu of moving pictures and describing
the scenes that flow into one another.
