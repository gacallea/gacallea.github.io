I have been passionately involved with
[Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), [Open
Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), [Creative
Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), and
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux). In 2002, I fell in love with the
ethos, the philosophy, and the philanthropy of it all. Becoming a proponent
activist. Involved with ideas, coding, active participation and teachings. I
used to be a professional [System
Administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator).

An akin area of interest is the [Cardano](https://cardano.org)
[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The abundant
similarities and the same revolutionary ethos led me to partake in the Cardano
ecosystem as a [stake pool
operator](https://docs.cardano.org/operating-a-stake-pool/about-stake-pools/)
and [Shelley
Pioneer](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/29/from-byron-to-shelley-part-one-the-testnets/).
Until, one day, I sadly [lost anything digitally
relevant](https://twitter.com/insaladaPool/status/1380087586509709312). Thanks
to [Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/) I fell in love with [Functional
Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). Especially
with [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), and
[Roc](https://roc-lang.org/). In an ideal world I would probably be a functional
programmer.

I'm currently learning Swift and studying CS Fundamentals (DSA, Complexity,
OOP, DDD, Agile). I'd love to learn Elixir as well. Apps need a back-end and I
love to be a well-rounded and complete professional. Plus, Elixir has a great
ecosystem, community, and market opportunities. In the recent past, I've
learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Elm; to make my own websites. Then
explored and abandoned it as a career path.

When I left system administration behind, in 2017, I've earned my diploma at
VFS and explored a creative career as a sound designer. That didn't pan out.
Thus, I'm determined to become a professional Swift developer. Programming apps
brings together the creative and the technical. Moreover, I love doing UI/UX
and have more ideas than I can bring to fruition. Swift and apps fill just the
right spot of the Venn diagram that is my experience in a number of fields.
