I have been involved with [Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft),
[Open Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software),
[Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), and
[Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), since 2002. At first, because of
the ethos, the philosophy, and the philanthropy of it all. Then, as a
proponent, I was involved with writings, ideas, coding, active participation
and teachings. Professionally, as Linux
[SysAdmin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) for 15 years.

An akin area of interest is the [Cardano](https://cardano.org)
[blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). The abundant
similarities and the same revolutionary ethos led me to partake in the Cardano
ecosystem as a [stake pool
operator](https://docs.cardano.org/operating-a-stake-pool/about-stake-pools/)
and [Shelley
Pioneer](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/04/29/from-byron-to-shelley-part-one-the-testnets/).
Until, one day, I sadly [lost anything digitally
relevant](https://twitter.com/insaladaPool/status/1380087586509709312). Thanks
to [Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/) I fell in love with [Functional
Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming).

After my [failed attempt at professional sound
design](/content/sound/_index.md), I've been on a learning path leading back
to IT as a professional developer. TLDR: I'm studying [CS
Fundamentals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science); I'm an
aspiring Rustacean in love with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Long story

After my [failed attempt at professional sound
design](/content/sound/_index.md), I've been on a learning path leading back to
IT as a professional developer. At first - since I love crafting UIs, UXs,
apps, and websites - I explored front end and mobile apps development. I've
learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript; and Swift to some extent.

On one hand, I appreciated learning and being able to code my own websites. On
the other hand, I felt unsatisfied and disillusioned. Since I had fallen in
love with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org), all I wanted to do was functional
programming professionally. Alas, a career with Elm or Haskell wasn't gonna be
for me - not for lack of trying - and I was ready to give up and be content
with a dead-end job to stay afloat and make music.

Before throwing the towel, I decided to explore Rust and see what it was all
about. Up until this point I had avoided it because of a narrow and uninformed
view: *low-level programming was definitely not for me*.

I familiarized with the language, the community, its tooling, its design and
more, and I fell in love. Rust felt like the language I had been dreaming about
for so long. Among many other things, its values and design aligned with what
I've always held high in a list of fundamental characteristics. Now, could it
be viable professionally? Whilst the market is momentarily unfavorable to a
beginner, Rust enables developing for a high number of technologies - including
full stack web and apps - and it's here to stay. Thus, I decided to bet my
future on it.
