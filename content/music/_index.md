I am an electronic music musician and producer with my own record label:
[Gentle Wash Records](<https://gentlewashrecords.com>). I am self-taught and I
compose electronic music by heart. My music has been praised by magazines, at
festivals and in theatres. Proudly aired on [WFMU](https://wfmu.org), featured
on [The Wire](https://thewire.co.uk), [Resonance
FM](https://www.resonancefm.com), and [Future
Ecologies](https://www.futureecologies.net/music).

I publish under two monikers
with different styles:

- [Aner Andros](https://gentlewashrecords.com/about/anerandros): a left-field,
darker, and introspective aesthetic.

- [GKRGY](https://gentlewashrecords.com/about/gkrgy): focusing on the rhythmic
and brighter side of tunes.

Over the years I have performed sporadically and with great enjoyment. I'm fond
of improvisation and of bespoke live shows. Using empathy and intuition as
critical factors in the making of musical voyages.
