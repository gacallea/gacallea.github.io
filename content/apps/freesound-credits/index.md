A command line utility to help you credit [Freesound](https://freesound.org)
samples for any given project.

## Why freesound-credits

Giving credits in the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org) community
is often the sole requirement to freely use samples in your own creations. This
tool helps you abide to [Copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)
and credit the generous artists that contribute sounds on
[Freesound](https://freesound.org), helping you being more creative.

Until today, giving credits may have been a process that you begrudged. This
may have been stopping you from giving credits altogether. Not because you
didn't want to, but because it was cumbersome and tedious.

Not anymore! Thanks to
[freesound-credits](https://github.com/gacallea/freesound-credits) utility it
takes seconds now!
