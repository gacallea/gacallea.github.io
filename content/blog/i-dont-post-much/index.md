Hi!

this is my first post just to notify you that - for the time being - I don't
post much here.

If you would like to follow or stay up to date with my shenanigans, Mastodon
and BlueSky are the places. Preferable, as they're more human. Social links in
the footer.

BTW, I don't post much there either but I like the community connections.

## Apps

Apps I create, have their own article. Check the apps top menu section!

Cheers drive! üçªüöå
