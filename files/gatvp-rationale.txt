The idea:

In this sound design piece, the emphasis is placed on the juxtaposition of
speed and still frames. In this trailer, the cars are captured into a precise
moment of the race: the car accident. The latter is perceived from the driver
perspective, inside the tumbling vehicle. Within the car accident, the emphasis
is placed in the shocked driver's mind, where I recreated an unsettling moment.
However, the race continues nonetheless (the show must go on), and the public
wants a winner, cheering for the remaining pilots. The accident leads and fades
back into the race and onto the end of the trailer.

Note on crash iterations:

I had to hold back on some other, more disturbing, implementations of the
accident moment, to free space for the crash sounds. This decision was made to
appeal more to the users/listeners and to not make them feel too uncomfortable.

Tools used:

- I designed the suspended moment and the fading cars in Ableton Live, without
  video, and Audacity, mostly using destructive editing (the original files
  were preserved for later use). Time stretching, choruses, delays, reverbs,
  frequency shifters, ring modulator, custom plugin-chains (Ableton racks) and
  Reaktor.

- I then integrated the above-mentioned sounds and layered/edited/mixed them
  with the selected sound from the given palette in Pro Tools, using additional
  sound processing where needed.

Note on mix:

- the entire sound design process was done in headphones, at home. I would have
  loved to take advantage of the mix lab and mix in 5.1 but I ran out of time.
